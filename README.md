# WorkspaceMonitorSystem
 This project aims at providing a healthy remote working space to employees. 
 
Idea behind this project:
As remote working is the new culture, we might have challenges like
1. We might spend more time in front of computer
2. We might work/ interact with N applications in a day
3. Spending too much time in front of computer can be stressfull and demotivating. Plus it affects ones productivity too.

So, it is essential to monitor our work and be reminded on timely basis that our health is important be prompted to basic exercises/ light body omvements to keep our body and mind fresh and healthy.
